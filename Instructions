The best way to start is probably running a single clinical classification experiment (run experiment_02_01.py after adjusting the paths)

SoftDecisionTree.py – Soft Decision Tree related classes and methods. Including visualization and probability tracking.

ShortMemorySoftDecisionTree.py – An extension class implementing Short-term Memory Soft Decision Tree.

experiment_01_ver03.1.py – Multiple experiments on simulated data

experiment_01_ver03_analysis_heatmap.py – analysis of the simulated experiments

experiment_02_01.py – run a single clinical data classification comparison

experiment_02_02.py – run multiple clinical data classification comparisons with various train/validation/test splits

experiment_02_02_analysis_02.py – analyse the multiple data classification comparisons results
